register read from target, write from arduino - wait, implemented in arduino
        write also sets data from arduino ready
        read clears data from arduino ready

register write from target, read from arduino
        write sets data from target ready
        read clears data from target ready 

2 status flipflops, read from either
        data from target ready
        data from arduino ready

cycles:

target-

400-47f read data from arduino, clear arduino data ready
480-4ff read status bits
500-5ff write to arduino, set target data ready

arduino-

Target/Ram 
Read/Write 
Control/Data 

T,R,C read status bits
T,R,D read data from target, clear target data ready
T,W,D write data to target, set arduino data ready

R,W,C clear counter
R,R,D read ram data, inc counter
R,W,D write ram data, inc counter

T,W,C - write status?
R,R,C - read counter?
